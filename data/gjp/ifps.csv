Also outside the scope of ""foreign or multinational military force"" are alleged actions attributed to covert intelligence services or representatives thereof, unless those actions are expressly acknowledged by a sponsoring nation's government. *""Significantly fired on"", however, is defined more broadly, to include bombs, missiles, chemical or other unconventional weapons or small arms fired on non-captive Iranian troops, soil, or naval vessels (including citizens within Iranian territory), military installations, or military vehicles (e.g., ships, subs, tanks, jets), such that at least 10 Iranians are killed.

Regardless of the person or entity making the announcement, the announcement must come from someone authorized to speak on behalf of the Canadian Government who is in fact making the announcement in a public and official capacity, conveying the concrete opening/closing of the Canadian consulate in Tehran.  In contrast, the following would not constitute an ""official"" announcement: conjecture, hypothetical statements, speculation, ultimatums, offhand remarks, or ""leaked"" private conversations. A UN nuclear inspector will only be considered to have visited the Parchin site if it is reported that they have physically visited the site in person; Iran ""allowing"" an inspection of the Parchin site or announcement of a planned future inspection is not sufficient for a ""Yes"" realization of the condition.  IAEA inspectors are considered UN nuclear inspectors for the purpose of this question.  Temporary suspension does not qualify as vacating office. Death of Assad constitutes vacation of office; temporary incapacitation due to routine medical procedure does not.  Whether prolonged medical incapacitation (e.g. coma) constitutes vacation of office will be determined on a case-by-case basis by a subject matter expert familiar with Syria succession law.  A formal announcement or letter of intent to resign that lists a specific date will be treated as constituting resignation.

To ""attempt a launch"" is defined as a launch resulting in a ""liftoff,"" regardless of whether or not the rocket/missile successfully leaves the atmosphere. Outcome will resolve ""yes"" whether the attempted launch is for purposes of testing or an actual military attack. ""Additional"" sanctions should be interpreted as any new sanctions, or the expansion or tightening of any existing sanctions. An official announcement is one made by a senior US spokesperson.

A foreign or multinational military force refers to some recognized subset of a nation's (or multinational coalition's) official military.  A significant attack is defined as any unwelcomed firing into North Korean territory or territorial waterways by a manned or unmanned foreign military aircraft, surface-to-surface artillery, gun, or rocket/missile firing ordnance or carrying explosives or bullets that cause the deaths of at least 5 North Korean citizens, and the attack must be officially acknowledged by the government of at least one of the attacking states.  An attack against a North Korean embassy abroad does not constitute an attack against North Korea.  Also outside the scope of attack are alleged actions attributed to covert intelligence services or representatives thereof, unless those actions are expressly acknowledged by the government of the attacking state(s).  A successful detonation of a nuclear device is defined as a detonation where a chain reaction occurs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_chain_reaction), whether that detonation occurs as a test explosion or as an actual military attack.  Note that computer simulations or controlled chain reactions within nuclear reactors do not constitute detonation of nuclear devices, and so-called ""dirty"" bombs do not constitute nuclear devices.

To qualify as an electoral democracy, a state must have satisfied the following criteria: A competitive, multiparty political system; Universal adult suffrage for all citizens (with exceptions for restrictions that states may legitimately place on citizens as sanctions for criminal offenses); Regularly contested elections conducted in conditions of ballot secrecy, reasonable ballot security, and in the absence of massive voter fraud, and that yield results that are representative of the public will; Significant public access of major political parties to the electorate through the media and through generally open political campaigning. Freedom House's term ""electoral democracy"" differs from ""liberal democracy"" in that the latter also implies the presence of a substantial array of civil liberties. In the survey, all Free countries qualify as both electoral and liberal democracies. By contrast, some Partly Free countries qualify as electoral, but not liberal, democracies.

Patterns of violent attacks by organizations that seek autonomy or independence are considered separatist rebellions, not insurgencies, and do not qualify. ""Between October 2013 and March 2014"" means at any time from 12:00 AM on the first day of October 2013 and 12:00 PM on the last day of March 2014. Outcome will be observed on a monthly basis by the Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS) using an algorithm applied to event data coded from an array of international news sources. Observation for the preceding month will occur on or about the fourth day of each subsequent month. For example, a determination of whether or not an onset of rebellion occurred in January will be made by ICEWS on or about 4 February using event data from all of January. Administrator reserves the right to review and overrule those automated monthly determinations in consultation with country and subject-matter experts. Any such review will only occur after ICEWS has delivered its monthly update, however, and will not be used to resolve the question in between those observations.

","The Arab Gas Pipeline carries natural gas from Egypt to Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Gas_Pipeline and http://www.petroleum.gov.eg/en/ProjectsandActivities/StrategicProjects/Pages/GasPipeline.aspx). For the resolution of this question, the Arish-Ashkelon Feeder Pipeline (which connects the Arab Gas Pipeline to Israel from Egypt) and the Egypt Gas Feeder Pipeline (which connects the Arab Gas Pipeline to Egypt) are not considered part of the Arab Gas Pipeline. Any attack on these feeder pipelines will not count toward the resolution of this question. A violent attack refers to any physical violence directed at the pipeline and supporting infrastructure that is described by relevant authorities as an attack, terrorism, sabotage, or in similar terms. Furthermore, any violent attacks on the pipeline and supporting infrastructure, including compression stations, metering stations, launching and receiving stations, and power connections will count but attacks on the power stations to which the pipeline is connected will not count toward the resolution. An explosion that reportedly results from a bomb or other sabotage would count as an attack; an explosion that reportedly results from a malfunction or accident would not. An attack with guns or other deadly devices and/or weapons on any workers or operators during working hours along the Arab Gas Pipeline sites will also count toward the total. Please note that the workers must be on the job and on site to be counted toward the total count of attacks; an attack on an off-duty employee will not suffice. The attack does not have to succeed at stopping or slowing the flow of natural gas to count toward the total; it only has to occur. The identity of the alleged attackers is irrelevant to the resolution of the question.

Isolated events and small, peaceful protests are not sufficient to cross the threshold for a domestic political crisis. Likewise, patterns of violent attacks on state targets are identified with rebellion and insurgency and therefore are not considered indicative of a domestic political crisis. ""Between December 2013 and April 2014"" means at any time from 12:00 AM on the first day of December 2013 and 12:00 PM on the last day of April 2014.

Observation for the preceding month will occur on or about the fourth day of each subsequent month. For example, a determination of whether or not an onset of rebellion occurred in January will be made by ICEWS on or about 4 February using event data from all of January. Administrator reserves the right to review and overrule those automated monthly determinations in consultation with country and subject-matter experts. Any such review will only occur after ICEWS has delivered its monthly update, however, and will not be used to resolve the question in between those observations.

The protesters occupied Maiden Square in late November 2013 after the government of Ukraine rejected an EU association agreement and accepted Russia's $15 billion financial aid package. For the purpose of this question, *""sanctions"" refer to financial and political sanctions, including but not limited to financial penalties, import tariffs, limitations or cancellations of high-level government visits, expelling or withdrawing diplomatic missions or staff, or bans on trades. Only new sanctions established after 19 February 2014 will count toward the resolution of this question; previous sanctions, old sanctions that were removed, or sanctions currently in place will not suffice. However, sanctions that were previously lifted but are reinstated after 19 February 2014 will suffice for a ""yes"" resolution. For a ""yes"" resolution to occur, sanctions can be imposed against Yanukovich himself, against any individual member of his government, or against the Ukrainian government as a whole. Outcome will be determined by the Government using open sources, such as Reuters, BBC, Associated Press, or question-specific sources (e.g., Freedom House, U.S. Department of State, the EU). If nothing is reported in these sources, then the ""status quo"" outcome (i.e., no new sanctions imposed on Yanukovich or members of his government) will be assumed.
